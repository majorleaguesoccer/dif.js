[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/majorleaguesoccer/dif.js.png)](http://travis-ci.org/majorleaguesoccer/dif.js) 

Find the difference between two objects.


Usage
-----

Node.js

```js
var dif = require('dif')
```

Browser

```html
<script src="dif.min.js"></script>
```

Options
-------

You can supply an options hash as the third argument to change behavior

* `preserve` - preserve nested objects (optional, default `true`)
* `depth` - nested object depth to begin preserving (optional, default `1`)
* `removed` - consider missing properties as removed (optional, default `false`)


Example
-------

Basic usage

```js
var a = {foo: 1, bar: 2}
var b = {bar: 4, baz: true}
var c = dif(a, b)
// {
//   foo: 1
// , bar: 4
// , baz: true
// }
```

We can find the diffs for nested objects as well

```js
var a = {
  one: {
    red: 2
  , blue: 3 
  , two: {
      yellow: 4
    , pink: 5
    }
  }
}
var b = {
  one: {
    two: {
      'three'
    }
  }
}
var c = dif(a, b)
{
  one: {
    two: {
      'three'
    }
  }
}
```
